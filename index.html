        <strong>The Sea Is Divided</strong>
        <br>
        <span class="chapter">14</span>
        <sup id='1' hidden>13</sup>But Moses said to the people, “Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the Lord which He will accomplish
        for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
        <sup hidden>14</sup>The Lord will fight for you while you keep silent.”
        <sup hidden>15</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward.
        <sup hidden>16</sup>As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the sons of Israel
        shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land.
        <sup hidden>17</sup>As for Me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and I will
        be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
        <sup hidden>18</sup>Then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots
        and his horsemen.”
        <sup hidden>19</sup>The angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar
        of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
        <sup hidden>20</sup>So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness,
        yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night.
        <sup hidden>21</sup>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord swept the sea back by a strong east wind all
        night and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided.
        <sup hidden>22</sup>The sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters were like a wall to
        them on their right hand and on their left.
        <sup hidden>23</sup>Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after
        them into the midst of the sea.
        <sup hidden>24</sup>At the morning watch, the Lord looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud
        and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion.
        <sup hidden>25</sup>He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians said,
        “Let us flee from Israel, for the Lord is fighting for them against the Egyptians.”
        <sup hidden>26</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the
        Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen.”
        <sup hidden>27</sup>So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while
        the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
        <sup hidden>28</sup>The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh’s entire army that had gone into
        the sea after them; not even one of them remained.
        <sup hidden>29</sup>But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were like a wall to
        them on their right hand and on their left.
        <sup hidden>30</sup>Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on
        the seashore.
        <sup hidden>31</sup>When Israel saw the great power which the Lord had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord,
        and they believed in the Lord and in His servant Moses.

        <strong>The Song of Moses and Israel</strong>
        <br>
        <span class="chapter">15</span>
        Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and said,
        <br>

        <div class="indent">“I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted;
            <br>The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>2</sup>“The Lord is my strength and song,
            <br>And He has become my salvation;
            <br>This is my God, and I will praise Him;
            <br> My father’s God, and I will extol Him.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>3</sup>“The Lord is a warrior;
            <br>The Lord is His name.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>4</sup>“Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea;
            <br>And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>5</sup>“The deeps cover them;
            <br>They went down into the depths like a stone.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>6</sup>“Your right hand, O Lord, is majestic in power,
            <br>Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>7</sup>“And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You;
            <br>You send forth Your burning anger, and it consumes them as chaff.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>8</sup>“At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up,
            <br>The flowing waters stood up like a heap;
            <br>The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>9</sup>“The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
            <br>My desire shall be gratified against them;
            <br>I will draw out my sword, my hand will destroy them.’
            <br>
            <sup hidden>10</sup>“You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them;
            <br>They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>11</sup>“Who is like You among the gods, O Lord?
            <br> Who is like You, majestic in holiness,
            <br>Awesome in praises, working wonders?
            <br>
            <sup hidden>12</sup>“You stretched out Your right hand,
            <br>The earth swallowed them.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>13</sup>“In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed;
            <br>In Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>14</sup>“The peoples have heard, they tremble;
            <br>Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>15</sup>“Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed;
            <br> The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them;
            <br>All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>16</sup>“Terror and dread fall upon them;
            <br> By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone;
            <br>Until Your people pass over, O Lord,
            <br>Until the people pass over whom You have purchased.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>17</sup>“You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance,
            <br> The place, O Lord, which You have made for Your dwelling,
            <br>The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.
            <br>
            <sup hidden>18</sup>“The Lord shall reign forever and ever.”
            <br>
        </div>
        <sup hidden>19</sup>For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the Lord brought back
        the waters of the sea on them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.

        <sup hidden>20</sup>Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her
        with timbrels and with dancing.
        <sup hidden>21</sup>Miriam answered them, “Sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted; The horse and his rider He has hurled
        into the sea.” The Lord Provides Water
        <sup hidden>22</sup>Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three
        days in the wilderness and found no water.
        <sup hidden>23</sup>When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was
        named Marah.
        <sup hidden>24</sup>So the people grumbled at Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”
        <sup hidden>25</sup>Then he cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree; and he threw it into the waters, and the waters
        became sweet. There He made for them a statute and regulation, and there He tested them.
        <sup hidden>26</sup>And He said, “If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the Lord your God, and do what is right in His
        sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which
        I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the Lord, am your healer.”

        <sup hidden>27</sup>Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there
        beside the
        <span id="end">waters</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The Lord Provides Manna</strong>
        <br>
        <span class="chapter">16</span>
        Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between
        Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
        <sup
            hidden>2</sup>The whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
        <sup hidden>3</sup>The sons of Israel said to them, “Would that we had died by the Lord’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we
        sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill
        this whole assembly with hunger.”
        <sup hidden>4</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and
        gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My instruction.
        <sup hidden>5</sup>On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.”
        <sup
            hidden>6</sup>So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, “At evening you will know that the Lord has brought you
        out of the land of Egypt;
        <sup hidden>7</sup>and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord, for He hears your grumblings against the Lord; and
        what are we, that you grumble against us?”
